# Agent-Based Modelling for Hospital Resource Allocation in Viral Crises

## Context

In viral crises such as the current COVID-19 situation, resources are limited in hospitals, such as hospital beds and staff. To exacerbate the situation, viruses can be transmitted as patients move from one station in the hospital to another.

## Objective

To explore an optimal and safer allocation of hospital resources and staff that maximises rate of patient recovery while minimising rate of patient viral transmission.

## Methodology

We plan to create a simulation of hospital operations. Hospital processes are modeled as Dynamical Systems where the rates of waiting times or time required for processes can be adjusted according to the particular hospital. Patients and staff can be modeled using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) with varying rates of transmission of viral infection.
